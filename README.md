## Background and Overview

As an avid skateboarder, I thought it would be fun to create a skateboard game to strengthen my Javascript skills, and learn to use Canvas HTML to do so.

## Functionality and MVP

  * Player should be able to mute music
  * Play through at least 3 levels
  * Generate points by lasting longer (avoiding holes in the ground)
  * Generate points by doing tricks
  * Save their high score via their initials on the high score board
